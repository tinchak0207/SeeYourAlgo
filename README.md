# OI Team Algorithm Visualizer 電培算法視覺化網站
本站從開源項目**algorithm-visualizer.org**改編而成，幾乎所有功能都是其他大佬製作，
本蒟蒻只對前端進行些許改造，以求舒適方便。

It is forked from the open project **algorithm-visualizer.org**, where I have made a minimal UI change to make the look more modern overall.
In this site you are able to "see" a lot of algorithm.
Hope it helps our school do better on OI.

## Introduction
Welcome to Algorithm Visualizer, an interactive online platform designed to bring algorithms to life through visualization. Whether you're a student, teacher, or professional, our platform provides an engaging way to explore and understand various algorithms.

## Key Features
<ul> 
<li>

### Visualize algorithms from code:
Algorithm Visualizer allows you to witness algorithms in action by visualizing code written in various programming languages. This visual approach facilitates a better understanding of algorithmic behavior..</li>
<li>

### Learn about Algorithms:
Explore our collection of tutorials, articles, and videos that serve as valuable resources for learning about algorithms.
</li>
</ul>

## algorithms
In this repository, you'll find visualizations of algorithms showcased in the website's side menu. Contributions here directly impact the educational content available on the platform.   https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms</li>
</ul>


## tracers
Explore the various visualization libraries in different programming languages. These libraries extract visualization commands from code.

## Contributing

Our project consists of multiple repositories, each playing a crucial role in the Algorithm Visualizer ecosystem. If you're interested in contributing, check out the guidelines for the specific repository:


- [**`algorithm-visualizer`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithm-visualizer) is a web app written in React. It contains UI components and interprets commands into visualizations. Check out [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [**`server`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/server) serves the web app and provides APIs that it needs on the fly. (e.g., GitHub sign in, compiling/running code, etc.)

- [**`algorithms`**](https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer/algorithms) contains visualizations of algorithms shown on the side menu of the website.

- [**`tracers.*`**](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Avisualization-library+org%3Aalgorithm-visualizer&type=Repositories) are visualization libraries written in each supported language. They extract visualizing commands from code.
